    <h3>Autobiographical Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hello, my name is Jarod Cahoon!</li>
        <li>I am from Grantsboro, North Carolina.</li>
        <li>I am a Sophomore, and will graduate in 2020</li>
        <li><h3>Questions:</h3></li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When did you first start using a computer?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">I first starting using a computer when I was around 6 or 7, when my dad would let me
                    sit on his lap and drag the cards across the screen when he won in Solitaire.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What kinds of computers have you used?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">I have used everything from an only MacIntosh we had at school to the computer I just
                    rebuilt a couple of weeks ago.
                </li>
                <li><strong>How do you use computers on a daily basis?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">I use computers to do everything from checking my email, to playing video games, to
                    browsing to net on my phone.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What do you think a computer scientist does on a daily basis?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">I think this is kind of a loaded question because I feel that what qualifies as a
                    "computer scientist" is very broad and contentious.
                    I think that people who would consider themselves "computer scientists" do everything from building
                    websites to studying graphs, to developing cryptographic algorithsm.
                    I feel that the field is very broad.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What event(s) made you interested in studying computer science and this course in
                    particular?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">At a young age I kind of wanted to know how a computer worked, and realized that I
                    couldn't rely on my somewhat Luddite parents to provide answers for me.
                    I ended up deciding to take this course simply because I felt like even after taking 3 or 4 other
                    computer science courses, I still knew absolutely nothing about how the internet
                    really works, or people interact with the internet.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What kinds of skills are required to code different parts of a web site?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">I honestly have no clue, but from what I have done in this assignment thus far, it
                    seems like a lot of a creativity and understanding of what you want to do with the
                    layout of the website before you even start using it.
                </li>
                <li><strong>How do you see yourself using computers in the future?</strong></li>
                <li class="answer">Though this might be kind of a sad answer, I feel that the reality of the future is
                    that our existence is inextricable from the use of computers. It feels like the
                    technological revolution has barely just began, but we still can barely go to the kitchen to get ice
                    cubes for our soda without using a computer in one way or another. In terms of what I would
                    <i>like</i> to do with computers -- I would have to say I would like to use computers to help make
                    the lives of others easier.

    I like cats. Here is an image

<h3>Good-Lookin' Wesbites</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.coolmath-games.com/">Here</a> is website that I thought would initially look ugly
        (it did back in the day), but now looks pretty good. Everything is well laid out and easy to find!
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Another</a> fairly good looking website, which is to be expected from a
        website of a company which creates websites. It is aesthetically clean, nice to look at, and makes me want to
        buy
        their product, so I guess it kind of works!
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Ugly Websites</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.3riversstadium.com/index2.html">On the other hand...</a>we have this website, which
        looks like it was built in the stone age. Everything is excruciating to find, and the sizing of the website
        doesn't fit the screen well. I suppose that it wasn't made to handle the new internet frameworks and whatnot,
        so I guess that it makes sense that it is ugly.
    </li>
    <li>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away-- I was in high school, and its <a
            href="http://pchs.pamlicoschools.org/">website</a> was not the best.
        Though I am honestly surprised to see that the website has gotten better, I still have to say that there are a
        lot of links on the website that lead to dead ends,
        or don't provide enough information.
    </li>
</ol>

        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-communication-network-services/lecture/jP4n1/web-server-and-client-interactions">Here</a>
        is a website for learning about client-server interactions. Coursera is one of my favorites.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/internet_technologies/internet_security_overview.htm">Here</a> is a
        resource for learning the basics
        of web security.
