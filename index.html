<h3>Good-Lookin' Wesbites</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.coolmath-games.com/">Here</a> is website that I thought would initially look ugly
        (it did back in the day), but now looks pretty good. Everything is well laid out and easy to find!
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Another</a> fairly good looking website, which is to be expected from a
        website of a company which creates websites. It is aesthetically clean, nice to look at, and makes me want to buy
        their product, so I guess it kind of works!
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Ugly Websites</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.3riversstadium.com/index2.html">On the other hand...</a>we have this website, which
        looks like it was built in the stone age. Everything is excruciating to find, and the sizing of the website
        doesn't fit the screen well. I suppose that it wasn't made to handle the new internet frameworks and whatnot,
        so I guess that it makes sense that it is ugly.
    </li>
    <li>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away-- I was in high school, and its <a href="http://pchs.pamlicoschools.org/">website</a> was not the best.
    Though I am honestly surprised to see that the website has gotten better, I still have to say that there are a lot of links on the website that lead to dead ends,
    or don't provide enough information.</li>
