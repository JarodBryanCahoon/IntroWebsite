                <strong>Fish Tank</strong> - When buying a fishtank, there are several things that you should consider
                about your purchase.
                One of the first, and most fundamental things that you should consider about your tank is what type of
                material you would
                like the tank to be made out of. Tanks are typically made out of either acryllic or glass, both of which
                are very similar, but slightly
                different. Acryllic is typically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSkxgz7-Z0">tougher</a> than
                glass, though it is often much softer,
                and will scratch more easily. Glass, on the other hand, is harder than glass, but is less tough, and
                runs a higher risk of being shattered during
                transportation. The next thing you should consider when buying a tank is the size of the tank. Tanks can
                range from 1 gallon, to 200 plus, and for good reason.
                Certain animals will often require more room than other animals in tanks, which should be considered.
                Colleges/apartments sometimes have regulations on the maximum
                size of fishtanks, so check those requirements before you buy a tank. Additionally, keep in mind that
                water is <strong>extremely</strong> heavy, and tanks larger than
                15 gallons or so require specialized stands that can withstand the weight of the tank. A 30 gallon tank
                contains ~250 pounds of water, which can make some full tanks
                approach 300 pounds fully filled. <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/">Petsmart</a> often has "dollar per
                gallon" deals,
                in which they sale tanks up to around 75 gallons for around a dollar a gallon. Second-hand tanks are
                often a good option,
                with both <a href="https://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.craigslist.org">craigslist</a> commonly having listings
                for tanks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Filter</strong> - Filters are needed to keep the water of a fishtank clean, and are imperative
                for the health of the animals in the tank.
                There are several different styles of fishtank filters, from <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/BACTO-SURGE-HIGH-DENSITY-FOAM-FILTER/dp/B00GOFPX9I/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1515969140&sr=1-4&keywords=sponge+filter">sponge</a>
                filters to <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetra-25774-Whisper-Filter-40-Gallon/dp/B0002DHY6I/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1515969234&sr=1-2&keywords=tetra+whisper+filter">traditional</a>
                filters,
                to even <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Aquarium-Filter-Bio-balls-Filtration-1-inch/dp/B00F11B6ME/ref=sr_1_3?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1515969263&sr=1-3&keywords=bio+balls">bio-balls</a>.
                Each of these function
                in a slightly different way, but ultimately serve the same purpose. Depending on what type of tank/size
                of tank that you have, and what resides in it, one filter may be preferable to another.

                <strong>Vacuum Cleaner</strong> - Though the filter on the fishtank make keep the water itself clean
                enough for fish to swim in, they typically are not powerful enough
                to remove all plant detritus/excess food from falling to the bottom of the tank. If left uncleaned at
                the bottom of the tank, this food/detritus can decompose and cause an ammonia spike in your tank,
                which could potentially kill your fish if not quickly handled. Most of the vacuums for aquariums are
                simple <a

                motors</a> can also be bought. Since fish tanks can already be pricey,
                I think that a hand pump is adequate for the most part.

            <li>
                Cycling a fishtank is the act of creating a healthy bacterial environment within the fishtank,
                such that ammonia waste produced by the organisms within the tank is properly handled. This cycle of
                breaking down
                ammonia is known as the <i>Nitrogen Cycle</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                This cycle is <strong>essential</strong> to ensure that all of the critters living in your tank are
                as healthy as possible. Low ( > 0) ppm of ammonia and nitrites in the water can make your animals
                lethargic or sick,
                and high ppm of ammonia and aitrites in the water can kill your animals outright, depending on the
                hardiness of the
                species.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only <strong>after</strong> a fishtank has been cycled should animals be placed in your tank. Though you
                have
                already completed a cycle of the tank at this point, you should continue to monitor the water quality of
                the tank
                multiple times a week to ensure that no ammonia/nitrite/nitrate spikes occur.

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jarod Cahoon, and I attend Duke University. I grew up in eastern North Carolina, and consequently
    frequented local beaches throughout my childhood, which fostered an admiration and respect for both marine
    environments,
    and nature in general. Being relatively far away from the coast with obligations makes it hard for me to live by and
    experience the beauty of what I grew up to know first hand. Having an aquarium in my apartment provides me with a
    readily
    available place which provides for me similar feelings that going to the beach did, namely : a sense of personal
    responsibility,
    respect for nature, and a place for introspective thought about the nature of life, and my place within it.</p>
