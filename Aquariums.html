<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jarod Cahoon, and I attend Duke University. I grew up in eastern North Carolina, and consequently
    frequented local beaches throughout my childhood, which fostered an admiration and respect for both marine
    environments,
    and nature in general. Being relatively far away from the coast with obligations makes it hard for me to live by and
    experience the beauty of what I grew up to know first hand. Having an aquarium in my apartment provides me with a
    readily
    available place which provides for me similar feelings that going to the beach did, namely : a sense of personal
    responsibility,
    respect for nature, and a place for introspective thought about the nature of life, and my place within it.</p>
