                <strong>Fish Tank</strong> - When buying a fishtank, there are several things that you should consider
                about your purchase.
                One of the first, and most fundamental things that you should consider about your tank is what type of
                material you would
                like the tank to be made out of. Tanks are typically made out of either acryllic or glass, both of which
                are very similar, but slightly
                different. Acryllic is typically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSkxgz7-Z0">tougher</a> than
                glass, though it is often much softer,
                and will scratch more easily. Glass, on the other hand, is harder than glass, but is less tough, and
                runs a higher risk of being shattered during
                transportation. The next thing you should consider when buying a tank is the size of the tank. Tanks can
                range from 1 gallon, to 200 plus, and for good reason.
                Certain animals will often require more room than other animals in tanks, which should be considered.
                Colleges/apartments sometimes have regulations on the maximum
                size of fishtanks, so check those requirements before you buy a tank. Additionally, keep in mind that
                water is <strong>extremely</strong> heavy, and tanks larger than
                15 gallons or so require specialized stands that can withstand the weight of the tank. A 30 gallon tank
                contains ~250 pounds of water, which can make some full tanks
                approach 300 pounds fully filled. <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/">Petsmart</a> often has "dollar per
                gallon" deals,
                in which they sale tanks up to around 75 gallons for around a dollar a gallon. Second-hand tanks are
                often a good option,
                with both <a href="https://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.craigslist.org">craigslist</a> commonly having listings
                for tanks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Filter</strong> - Filters are needed to keep the water of a fishtank clean, and are imperative
                for the health of the animals in the tank.
                There are several different styles of fishtank filters, from <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y97coq8h">sponge</a>
                filters to <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y83fb9xp">traditional</a>
                filters,
                to even <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y7nrx5qf">bio-balls</a>.
                Each of these function
                in a slightly different way, but ultimately serve the same purpose. Depending on what type of tank/size
                of tank that you have, and what resides in it, one filter may be preferable to another.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vacuum Cleaner</strong> - Though the filter on the fishtank make keep the water itself clean
                enough for fish to swim in, they typically are not powerful enough
                to remove all plant detritus/excess food from falling to the bottom of the tank. If left uncleaned at
                the bottom of the tank, this food/detritus can decompose and cause an ammonia spike in your tank,
                which could potentially kill your fish if not quickly handled. Most of the vacuums for aquariums are
                simple <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/yaflrpen">hand
                pumps</a> with a grate to prevent substrate from being sucked out, though nicer models,
                with <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/yd3rwzxa">actual
                motors</a> can also be bought. Since fish tanks can already be pricey,
                I think that a hand pump is adequate for the most part.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Thermometer/Heater</strong> - Most fish/invertibrates that you will be storing in a fish tank
                will be extremely
                temperature sensitive, which makes it necessary to not only have a way to measure the temperature, but
                also a way
                to ensure that the water is warm. These items can be found cheaply on Amazon or in your local fish
                store, but I would
                specifically recommend a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc5chmt6">heater</a> which automatically maintains
                a certain temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Light</strong> - Just like humans, most fish can have a circadian rhythm, and be photosensitive.
                Typically, unless your tank is stored directly adjacent to a window, it can be difficult for an unlit
                tank
                to get adequate light. For this reason, it is recommended for most tanks that you buy a light to either
                attach
                to the hood, or place directly above the open tank. Most fish tank <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y93nex3j">"beginner kits"</a>
                come with a light. While it is important that you do provide a light for your tank, it is perhaps more
                important
                that the light does not stay on longer than ~6 hours a day. Prolonged light exposure in a tank can cause
                excess
                algae to bloom, which could damage the health of the tank. For this, I would recommend a <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y8oxp4zo">programmable switch</a>
                , which can be used to set the hours in which your light should turn or off. If you are interested in
                having a
                planted tank, then the lighting of the tank becomes even more important, and there are <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/y899zq2v">customizable lights</a>
                which allow you to specify the wavelength of light you want, to maximize the growth of your plants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Surface Agitation</strong> - The last major component of any good tank setup is something which
                "agitates"
                the water's surface, or causes it to move. In nature, most inhabitable bodies of water are constantly in
                motion, be it from
                whatever force. This motion causes the surface of the water to continuously coalesce and overlap with
                the air around it,
                doing two distinct things. First, this motion causes oxygen from the air to be introduced, and
                eventually dissolved, into
                the water. Second, this causes any biological buildup on the surface of the water to be continually
                mixed back into the water,
                and not allowed to settle on the top. Because a fish tank (hopefully) will not be subject to any storms
                or violent
                shaking, this means that it needs to be introduced into the system deliberately. The main way of doing
                this is through
                the use of an <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yabt5lde">air stone</a>, though if you purchased a sponge
                filter they commonly do this by default. Regardless of which
                option you pick, however, an <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc3sz73x">air pump</a> and <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/ybh6po3h">tubing</a> are required.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Cycling a fishtank is the act of creating a healthy bacterial environment within the fishtank,
                so that ammonia waste produced by organisms within the tank is properly handled. This cycle of
                breaking down
                ammonia is known as the <i>Nitrogen Cycle</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                This cycle is <strong>essential</strong> to ensure that all of the critters living in your tank are
                as healthy as possible. Low ( > 0) ppm of ammonia and nitrites in the water can make your animals
                lethargic or sick,
                and high ppm of ammonia and aitrites in the water can kill your animals outright, depending on the
                hardiness of the
                species.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only <strong>after</strong> a fishtank has been cycled should animals be placed in your tank. Though you
                have
                already completed a cycle of the tank at this point, you should continue to monitor the water quality of
                the tank
                multiple times a week to ensure that no ammonia/nitrite/nitrate spikes occur.

    <li class="noBullet"><h2><a>Cleaning a Tank</a></h2></li>
    <li class="noBullet">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cleaning a tank is essential to ensuring that the water your pets live in does not become contaminated
                by their own waste,
                or excess food.
            </li>
            <li>
                Typically, a tank should be cleaned about once a week, or even more if you have an especially productive
                tank
                which produces a lot of waste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cleaning involves vacuuming as much of the detritus and extra food out of substrate of the tank as
                possible,
                and then replacing this water with water that has been treated to remove chlorine or any other additives
                which
                may make your animals sick.
            </li>
            <li>
                The glass of the tank should also be cleaned regularly, not only for your viewing pleasure, but also
                to prevent algae from taking over your tank, and potentially poisoning all of your animals. Cleaning the
                glass
                can consist of simply wiping out the tank with the a clean washcloth or paper towel, or purchasing
                animals
                which can clean the algae off of the glass.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should also regularly perform water changes in the tank. This can often be done at the same time as
                cleaning
                the gravel, as most gravel vacuums also suck up the water. Performing regular water changes is necessary
                to removing
                any built up chemicals in the water which are too heavy or difficult for the bacterial medium in your
                filter to remove.

    <li class="noBullet"><h2><a>Freshwater vs Saltwater Tanks</a></h2></li>
    <li class="noBullet">
        <ul>
            <li>
                This is an extremely complicated topic that I have very limited knowledge about, so I will keep it
                simple
            </li>
            <li>
                Saltwater tanks, and consequently saltwater animals, are much harder to keep healthy and maintain than
                freshwater tanks and freshwater fish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consequently, I would <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you do not try a saltwater tank if you
                are a beginner aquarist, or if you have not sat down and made a plan for all of the items, or how you
                will afford them.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Just like humans, some fish/invertebrates do not get along with one another. In a fishtank where
                there are many potential predator/prey relationships at stake, this means that you could potentially
                lose a lot of money on animals that you bought.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before purchasing your primary tank inhabitant, consider whether or not adding this inhabitant to the
                tank would prevent you from successfully fostering another inhabitant in the future. For instance, male
                Betta fish are very aggressive, and will attack a <strong>huge</strong> swath of other animals, so
                purchasing
                a male Betta instantly eliminates a lot of other potential tankmates as options.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before purchasing any additional tank inhabitants, ensure that what you currently have in the tank will
                not
                attack what you are purchasing, or vice versa. In addition, consider that it can take up to several
                weeks
                for a new tank inhabitant to "settle in", meaning that it is possible for aggression to occur between
                species which otherwise would not be aggressive towards one another.

            <li class="noBullet"><p>These freshwater frogs are both super interesting to look at and super interesting to interact with.
                Because they are fully aquatic, only needing to come up and get air from time to time, they work well in
                freshwater
                tanks. They are also a nice breath of fresh air from the typical tank inhabitants, which are usually
                fish or

            <li class="noBullet"><p>The harlequin shrimp is an awesome looking saltwater shrimp whose diet consists of strictly one animal :
            starfish. This makes the harlequin shrimp incredibly hard to house and maintain, since you also have to actively

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jarod Cahoon, and I attend Duke University. I grew up in eastern North Carolina, and consequently
    frequented local beaches throughout my childhood, which fostered an admiration and respect for both marine
    environments,
    and nature in general. Being relatively far away from the coast with obligations makes it hard for me to live by and
    experience the beauty of what I grew up to know first hand. Having an aquarium in my apartment provides me with a
    readily
    available place which provides for me similar feelings that going to the beach did, namely : a sense of personal
    responsibility,
    respect for nature, and a place for introspective thought about the nature of life, and my place within it.</p>
